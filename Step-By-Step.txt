1- Creating a .Net project and using EF. 
2- dotnet new sln to create a solution
3- dotnet new wepapi -n API to create an API folder with relevant code for us. But because I wanted .net 5, I used below command: 
dotnet new webapi --framework "net5.0" -n API
4- dotnet new classlib  --framework "net5.0" -n Application
5- dotnet new classlib  --framework "net5.0" -n Domain
6- dotnet new classlib  --framework "net5.0" -n Persistence
7-dotnet sln add API/API.csproj & Application & Domain & Persistence
8-cd API then dotnet add reference ../Application
8-Add ref to domain and Persistence for pplication. 
9- add ref to domain for Persistence.
10- In domain project delete class1 class and add another class witht the name of Activity
11- install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer on Persistence project.
12- Add DataContext to Persistence project. 
13- Derived class from DbContext
14- Add dbcontext into services on startup.cs file in api project. 
15- For adding EF we need tool that we check with this command: dotnet tool list --global.
16- We installed Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design on API project
17- we use this command to make migration enable:  dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API
18- Did the changes in the program file of API project.
19- For seeding database, we created a new class in Persistence with the name of seed.cs and then we call seed method from Program.
20- Add a BaseApiController.cs to Controllers folder in API. 
21- Then we added ActvitiesController. 
****************************************** End Of Section 2: API Skeleton ******************************************************
1- Create react app.  React Dev tools. Typescript. Axios. Semantic-ui.
2- create a react app by below command: 
npx create-react-app client-app --use-npm --template typescript
3- We will use Axios to call our API because it is high level and Intercept requests and responses. JS has its http as well, But
it is low level. 
4- In the client-app folder execute npm install axios to install axios.
5- By useState and useEffect we fetch data from API. 
  const [activities, setActivities] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get("http://localhost:5000/api/activities").then((response) => {
      console.log(response);
      setActivities(response.data);
    });
  }, []);

  6- We are going to install semantic-ui-react by: npm install semantic-ui-react and npm install semantic-ui-css
  7- import ths line above of the index.tsx : import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css'
  8- Now we can use semantic ui components. Like Headerm List
****************************************** End Of Section 3: UI Skeleton ******************************************************
1- Looking at clean architecture pattern. CQRS + Mediator pattern
2- Command and Query Responsibility Segregation : Commands do something and Queries just do query DB.
3- Add mediator package to our Application project.  MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
4- In the application project create a folder with the name of activities. 
5- Add a class witht hename of list and add in the class a query class and a handler class implement interface. 
6- Inject datacontext into Handler class. 
7- In the activities controller now we should inject our mediator instead of datacontext. 
8- We add mediator service into startup class.
9- wE MOVED MEDIATOR INJECTING TO OUR BASE API.
10- We added detail, create , edit into mediator and add them to ontroller as well.
11- Now we want to add automapper. So when code get an object and wants to update it, we do not need to write every property.
12- Open nuget galler and search for automapper and install it on application project. 
AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
13- in the application project create a new folder and call it core. 
14- Then we add mappingprofile class inherited from profile class from AutoMapper. 
15- In the onstructor we mapp our classes.
16- We add this MappingProfile class to our services in the startup method. 
17- We inject it into handler classes in application project and use it in edit method. 
18- Add an extention to house keeping the startup class.
****************************************** End Of Section 4: CQRS,Mediator,AutoMapper *********************************************
1- Create a CRUD application in React. Folder structure, Typescript Interfaces, Semantiic UI, Basic Forms
2- For our client app folder structure we added 2 folder in src. app=> normal codes features=>specific components
3- move app.css,index.css into app/layout and rename index.css to styles.css
4- adding activity interface. From swagger get the json and use json to ts tool to convert it to ts.
5- in the app folder create another folder with the name of models
6- add Activity.ts and paste the model in there.
7- How we use?In app file where we are using state, we set the type.Now we can remove any from map section. (smart)
8- Add Navbar: From semantic ui will find a navbar. In app/layout we added NavBar.tsx. Use Menu to create a NavBar.
9- For images we added a folder with the name of assets in the public folder. And put files there (logo)
10- we added navbar to our app component. To remove extra div we ued Fragment.
11- Creating an activity dashboard. In app/features we created a new folder with the name of activities.
12- We added activitiesdashboard and its interface to import data from parent to child.
13-We added activityList component.
14- We added a folder to activity with the name of detials. add ActivityDetails component. 
15- For genereate unique id from UI we need to use uuid. npm install uuid
then if we have error for import v4 as uuid we should use: npm i --save-dev @types/uuid
****************************************** End Of Section 5: UI:CRUD *********************************************
1- we will configure Axios to send data from Client side to API. Using genereic types by TS. Axios interceptors. 
2- We are looking to centeralised our axios request. So in the APP folder we added an API folder. 
3- Add a file with the name of agent.ts. We implenet all our api calls in this file. 
4- Adding fake delay: Add sleep into agent file. Use axios interceptors for response to make delay.
5- Add LoadingComponent.tsx into app/layout folder. Use dimmer and loading from semantic ui. 
6- Implementing loading for delete button to show only for one button in list component.
****************************************** End Of Section 6: Connect to API, loading animation ********************
1- MobX : introduce state management. We need to Mobx React Lite. Centeral state management.
2- Why MobX? It is easy with TS. Simpler to read. 
3- MobX use observables. when state changes we can react to that state. 
4= MobX uses classes to save states. 
5- MobX has action and computed property. it has reaction to ract to changes. 
6- When we use MobX, we will create a store which all componentes will have access tohis store.
7- Settin up MobX: npm install mobx mobx-react-lite
8- In the app folder create a new folder with the name of sotres.
9- With MobX we can use different stores instead of one store which is leagcy of react. 
10- Create activityStore.ts in the store folder. Write code.
11- Add store.ts and add required code.
12- In the index.tsx we add our storecontext.prvider tag around app. 
13- We started to clean up app.tsx component. 
14- For making or component observable we should chagen export default of them is observer. 
15- Start to refactoring code to export states from app.tsx to activityStpre. 
16- We are going to use maps instead of array for activitties.
****************************************** End Of Section 7: Change state manager to mobx and activities array to map ********************
1- Why do we need a router? React-Router and React-Router API and history. 
2- React Router. npm install react-router-dom
4- inside the app folder I created router folder. 
5- I created the Routes file and develop it. 
6- For our application to use router we need to replace it with app in index.tsx
7- for testing routing we need some pages to route. I added home in features.
8- We need a router outlet. We swaped         <ActivityDashboard /> in app.tsx with <Outlet/>
9- We move activities loading from home page ( app.tsx) to activities page.
10- Create navlinks in navbar
11- Difference between navlink and link is that navlink 
****************************************** End Of Section 8: Routing **********************************************************************
1- we used reduce function to group activities in the activitylist component.
2- Install react-calendar to use calendar. npm install react-calendar and then npm install @types/react-calendar
3- Then add into index.tsx : import 'react-calendar/dist/Calendar.css' 
****************************************** End Of Section 9: Styling **********************************************************************
