1- Creating a .Net project and using EF. 
2- dotnet new sln to create a solution
3- dotnet new wepapi -n API to create an API folder with relevant code for us. But because I wanted .net 5, I used below command: 
dotnet new webapi --framework "net5.0" -n API
4- dotnet new classlib  --framework "net5.0" -n Application
5- dotnet new classlib  --framework "net5.0" -n Domain
6- dotnet new classlib  --framework "net5.0" -n Persistence
7-dotnet sln add API/API.csproj & Application & Domain & Persistence
8-cd API then dotnet add reference ../Application
8-Add ref to domain and Persistence for pplication. 
9- add ref to domain for Persistence.
10- In domain project delete class1 class and add another class witht the name of Activity
11- install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer on Persistence project.
12- Add DataContext to Persistence project. 
13- Derived class from DbContext
14- Add dbcontext into services on startup.cs file in api project. 
15- For adding EF we need tool that we check with this command: dotnet tool list --global.
16- We installed Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design on API project
17- we use this command to make migration enable:  dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API
18- Did the changes in the program file of API project.
19- For seeding database, we created a new class in Persistence with the name of seed.cs and then we call seed method from Program.
20- Add a BaseApiController.cs to Controllers folder in API. 
21- Then we added ActvitiesController.
